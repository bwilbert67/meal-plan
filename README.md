# TE-Eatz

This repository contains the code for my final project at Tech Elevator. Special shoutout to my teammates Bree, Erica, Michael, and Noah and of course the TE team of Yoav, Noble, Lisa, and Shawn.

Tech Stack 
  - Java Spring Boot Backend 
  - PostgreSQL Database
  - Vue.js Frontend 

Functionality 
  - Users can...
    - create an account and login
    - add ingredients to the database
    - add recipes with a picture, ingredients, instructions, and title
    - view their past recipes
    - create a meal plan within a date range. Each meal in a meal plan can have multipl recipes (main dish, side dish, anything you want!)
    - view the titles of their meal plans
    - create a grocery list 
    - check items off their grocery list 

Future Improvements 
  - allow users to view the details of their meal plans 
  - make the picture associated with meal plans relevaant to the meal plan instead of default picutres 
  - allow grocery lists to be generated based on a meal plan
